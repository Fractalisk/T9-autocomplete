= T9 Predictive text AHK script

== Introduction
We coded a predictive text algorithm that suggests words of similar character length on the go through an
interactive GUI as the user types through autohotkey. As including the entire standard english dictionary
into the program makes it extremely space inefficient, we instead obtained a list of the 10000 most used english
words derived from Google's trillion words corpus, which decreased the size of the word dictionary from 6mb
to 74 kb.
